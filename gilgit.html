            <p>
                The North of Pakistan is famous for its unique cultural heritage and breathtaking sceneries, etching it on the top of
                Pakistan vacation destinations. Following pursuit of it's uniqueness, the street food there is also unlike anything else 
                you'll find in other cities of Pakistan. From soups to breads to pies like Chapshoro and even seafood, Gilgit leaves 
                nothing to desire when it comes to appetizing foods.
                The street food here blends local ingredients with the influence of Central Asian and Tibetan flavors, 
                resulting in hearty and comforting dishes. Here's a closer look at the street food scene in Gilgit:
